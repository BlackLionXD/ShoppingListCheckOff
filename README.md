# ShoppingListCheckOff
This repository is dedicated to my Assignment 2 project for the Coursera course. The project focuses on creating a user-friendly "check off" shopping list application, aimed at simplifying the management of shopping items. It presents users with two distinct lists: 'To Buy' and 'Already Bought'. The primary goal is to enable users to effortlessly mark items as 'bought', transitioning them from the 'To Buy' list to the 'Already Bought' list with a single click. Leveraging the power of AngularJS, the application delivers dynamic functionality and responsiveness.

At its core, the project utilizes AngularJS to implement a robust architecture comprising multiple controllers and a service. This architecture ensures efficient data sharing between the various components of the application, facilitating seamless interaction and a smooth user experience. Each controller is responsible for managing a specific aspect of the application, such as displaying the 'To Buy' and 'Already Bought' lists and handling user interactions.

The 'To Buy' list is pre-populated with a diverse array of items, each denoted by its name and quantity. Users can easily identify and select items they wish to purchase, with the option to mark them as 'bought' as they proceed through their shopping journey. As items are marked as 'bought', they are automatically moved to the 'Already Bought' list, where users can track their purchases and maintain an organized record of their shopping activities.

In addition to its functional aspects, the project emphasizes clean and intuitive design principles, ensuring that users can navigate the application effortlessly and complete their shopping tasks with ease. The user interface is carefully crafted to provide a seamless experience across devices, catering to the diverse needs of modern shoppers.

Overall, this project represents a culmination of my learning journey in AngularJS and showcases my ability to develop practical, real-world applications that address common user needs. Through thoughtful design and implementation, it aims to enhance the shopping experience and streamline the process of managing shopping lists.
